# Continuum Project

Cynobroad is getting rebranded, as promised, a year later, to Continuum! Expect stuff to not work and break.

Cynobroad is a lightweight and portable chat program for Windows 7 and later. Currently, it is under development and definitely not stable, so a release is provided only to play around with.

# What makes this one relatively special

Cynobroad primarily uses self-hosted lightweight servers that allow users to connect without the need for a central service like traditional chat apps might. This even means that Cynobroad can be painlessly setup on a network with no external connection to the internet, but still be used.

Cynobroad is also extremely lightweight, running at less than 15MB of RAM, even when hosting a server, and the whole installation comes under 700KB, making it extremely ideal for computers that cannot afford installing a relatively heavier application such as Discord.

# What is coming

Image and file transfer, emoji support, redesigned UI elements to bring the look up to speed, reactions, message editing, overall stability and polish, and much more. We aim to bring Cynobroad, in terms of basic functionality, on par with something like Discord or Skype.
